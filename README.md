An intelligent, adaptive encryption tool that hardens your security based on context.

DCF moves beyond static, one-size-fits-all encryption. It uses a pluggable policy engine to analyze the context of a file transfer‚Äîlike destination risk, data sensitivity, and device capabilities‚Äîto apply the optimal level of security and performance for every operation.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Threat-Adaptive Profiles**: Automatically adjusts encryption strength based on destination-aware risk scoring.
* **Content-Aware Compression**: Intelligently chooses between `lz4` for speed or `zlib` for size, based on file type.
* **Multi-Layer AEAD**: Applies multiple layers of modern, authenticated ciphers like `AES-GCM` and `ChaCha20-Poly1305` for robust security.
* **Hybrid Encryption**: Secures the encryption "recipe" using an `RSA-4069` + `AES-GCM` hybrid scheme.
* **Self-Describing Artifacts**: The output `.fortress` file contains everything needed to decrypt it, ensuring portability.

### üöÄ Quick Start

#### 1. Installation

First, clone the repository and set up the virtual environment. DCF requires Python 3.8+.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)
cd YOUR_REPO

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Usage Example
Follow these steps for a basic encrypt/decrypt cycle.

Step 1: Generate your RSA keys
This command creates public.pem and private.pem in the keys/ directory.

Bash

python fortress_mvp.py keygen --out-dir keys
Step 2: Prepare a sample file

Bash

echo "hello fortress" > sample.txt
Step 3: Encrypt the file
Here, we're simulating a high-risk destination (--dest-ip) to trigger a stronger security profile.

Bash

python fortress_mvp.py encrypt \
  --in sample.txt \
  --out sample.fortress \
  --dest-ip 216.3.128.12 \
  --recipient-pub keys/public.pem
Step 4: Decrypt the file

Bash

python fortress_mvp.py decrypt \
  --in sample.fortress \
  --out sample.out \
  --recipient-priv keys/private.pem
Step 5: Verify the integrity
This command should produce no output, confirming the original and decrypted files are identical.

Bash

diff -u sample.txt sample.out
üß† Using the Policy Engine
DCF's real power comes from its adaptive policy engine. You can provide additional context to influence the encryption strategy. The --explain flag shows the rationale behind the chosen security profile.

Example 1: A constrained laptop on a slow network
This context will likely cause the engine to select a balanced profile, possibly with more aggressive compression.

Bash

python fortress_mvp.py encrypt \
  --in sample.txt \
  --out sample.fortress \
  --dest-ip 216.3.128.12 \
  --recipient-pub keys/public.pem \
  --device-class laptop \
  --bandwidth-mbps 20 \
  --cpu-cores 4 \
  --battery-saver \
  --explain
Example 2: A trusted destination with a specific policy backend
Here, we're simulating a low-risk internal IP and explicitly using the simpler rule backend.

Bash

python fortress_mvp.py encrypt \
  --in sample.txt \
  --out sample.fortress \
  --dest-ip 10.0.0.5 \
  --recipient-pub keys/public.pem \
  --policy-backend rule \
  --explain
Note: lz4 is an optional dependency for faster compression. If it is not installed, the tool gracefully falls back to the built-in zlib library.
